## Description


## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Node.js
- npm (Node Package Manager)

## Backend Setup (Python)

1. Navigate to the backend directory:

   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```

2. Install the required Python dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the backend server:

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

   Your backend server should now be running.

## Frontend Setup (npm)

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```

2. Install the required npm packages:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the frontend server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   Your frontend should now be running and available in your browser.

## Usage

Once both the backend and frontend are running, open your browser and go to:

- Backend: `http://localhost:5000` (or the port specified in your Python app)
- Frontend: `http://localhost:3000` (or the port specified in your npm app)

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues, make sure that:
- All dependencies are installed properly.
- Both backend and frontend servers are running on different ports.
- Check the console logs for any errors.
